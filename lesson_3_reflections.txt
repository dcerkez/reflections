When would you want to create a remote repository rather then keeping all your work local?

    When you want to collaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It gives you the freedom to choose which branch to pull and when. It also gives you the
	possibility to pull changes in one branch from remote to more then one branch in local
	and to chose to which ones.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks works only on GitHub and it is cloning on behalf of user from another GitHub repository to user's copy.
	Clones are copies of some repository either locally or from remote repository. Branch is local bifurcation
	from commit into two independents branches.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	The benefit is that from that last known state of the remote any new commit on remote (origin )could be appended to that commit
	thus forming the branch (origin/master). Then that branch containing all the remote commits (after git fetch origin) could be merged to local branch
	(by git merge master origin/master)
