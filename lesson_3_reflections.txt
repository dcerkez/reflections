When would you want to create a remote repository rather then keeping all your work local?

    When you want to collaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It gives you the freedom to choose which branch to pull and when. It also gives you the
	possibility to pull changes in one branch from remote to more then one branch in local
	and to chose to which ones.
